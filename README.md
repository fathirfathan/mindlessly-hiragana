## About
Been long enough since I've been learning to code. So I figured it would be a good idea to make a well designed and an aesthetically pleasing portfolio. And here we are, I followed some tutorials on youtube, and then added my own personal touches to it. Overall, it was a good learning experience. My main objective was to learn React JS and if along the way, I get to make an impressive portfolio, why not?

## Things I Learned
- React JS - I knew React before but was still rusty in it a little bit so this project gave me a lot of confidence in using it and hopefully I'll be able to create more interesting projects with it and increase my proficiency.
- Framer-Motion - I was familiar with this animation library via Youtube and was just astounded how easy it was to use and integrate inside the code to get some smooth animations!
- Sanity - Never heard of Sanity before this project came along. A super simple Content Management System so that people who don't know how to write code can easily change things for their website without ever breaking it. The ease of use with which you can customize the content inside it is insane.
- UI/UX Design Flows - Learning UI/UX design as a developer solidifies your understanding of good design and workflows.

## Problems I Encountered
Of Course there are always error that may pop up when creating a project. These were some of them:
- Render problems for some React components due to some names that I misspelled, a silly mistake which happens a lot in programming.
- Sanity failed to reload when I added something new to the website, after spending some time on the internet, I was able to find a solution.
- Some styling bugs in various devices which were solved by playing around with them for some time.

## My Takeaways
This is probably my first "Proper" personal project that I made which is live on the internet. Along with the techy "things" that I learned, I would like to share some general tips that may help others while creating big projects like this one.
- TAKE BREAKS! It's important to feel fresh when you're working on something and it's not a race so its okay if a bug is taking you a whole day to solve or you just don't have the energy to do anything right now.
- Don't let your ego get in the way of being efficient. Use whichever tools you like whether other people use them or not. You need to be comfortable with what you work with.
- Ask for help whenever you can, from wherever you can. The ego part comes again here. You don't know everything and neither does other programmers. We are all in an awesome community and we are here to help each other grow.
